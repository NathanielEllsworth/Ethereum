### Overview

During this assignment you will create a full stack web application using MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars. Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

This assignment is extremely open-ended but must meet the following criteria.
* Must include a MySQL Database.
* Must use CSV Files to populate your database.
* Your database must use _at least_ one JOIN.
* Must utilize **GET** and **POST** requests to query AND add data.
* Must use all methods for manipulating persistent storage (**CRUD**)
* Must use Handlebars for server-side rendering
* Must use Express for HTML and API routing (Remember that you can utilize `express.static()` middleware to serve static assets like css, images, client-side JavaScript files) 
* Must use best practices for front end HTML and CSS design.
* Must be deployed to Heroku.
* Must include a `package.json` file to manage project dependencies.
* Must include a `.gitignore` file to ignore directories that shouldn't be tracked by Git. (Examples to ignore: `node_modules/`, `idea/`, `.DS_Store`, and any other files/directories that should not be pushed to your repo.)

This assignment is a teaser for your final project, so make sure to make it count. This is a huge assignment that could used as an amazing portfolio piece in the future!
